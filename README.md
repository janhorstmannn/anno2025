Annotation in the sense of semantic enrichment of research objects is one of the central topics of the digital humanities. In keeping with the centrality of annotation as a humanities practice, articles repeatedly focus on the didactically reflected mediation of the annotation method. Games have long been used to impart knowledge, even if examples of DH are rare. The memory game Anno 2025 is dedicated to the playful mediation of the four annotation dimensions according to Horstmann and Seltmann (2024): in the narrowest sense (supplementing individual aspects of the object of study), in the narrow sense (meta-information on the object of study), in the broad sense (analysis of the object of study) and in the broadest sense (reference to the object of study).
